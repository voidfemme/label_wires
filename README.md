# WireLab - Fast and accurate wire Labeling

This program was created for generating csv files from user input data. It provides fields for a component, terminal block and terminal that can be edited independently to help increase the speed at which you can input a large number of labels at once. It stores files as `.cab` and `.wir` which are just json files. You can export a file to csv with an "export" button.
