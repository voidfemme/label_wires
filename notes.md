# Project Notes

I'm using the Factory pattern to establish a wiremanager vs a cablemanager. This isn't scalable?
On the other hand, I still want to be able to write separate csv export functions for each. I shouldn't 
touch this code until I'm sure.

save_file
export_to_csv
open_settings_window
quit_program
add_connection
delete_connection
edit_connection
undo
destination_increment_toggle
source_increment_toggle
